# Queing System in JS

## Tasks

### Task 0
Download, extract, and compile the latest stable Redis version (higher than 5.0.7 - https://redis.io/download/):
```
$ wget http://download.redis.io/releases/redis-6.0.10.tar.gz
$ tar xzf redis-6.0.10.tar.gz
$ cd redis-6.0.10
$ make
```

- Start Redis in the background with `src/redis-server`
```
$ src/redis-server &
```

- Make sure that the server is working with a ping `src/redis-cli ping`
```
PONG
```

- Using the Redis client again, set the value `School` for the key `Holberton`
```
127.0.0.1:[Port]> set Holberton School
OK
127.0.0.1:[Port]> get Holberton
"School"
```

- Kill the server with the process id of the redis-server (hint: use `ps` and `grep`)
```
$ kill [PID_OF_Redis_Server]
```

Copy the `dump.rdb` from the `redis-5.0.7` directory into the root of the Queuing project.
Requirements:
- Running `get Holberton` in the client, should return `School`
